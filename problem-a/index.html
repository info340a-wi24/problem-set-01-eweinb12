    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_(character)">Garfield</a> is an orange and black cartoon cat who was originally part of a comic strip. 
        The comic strip has since been turned into books, cartoons, and movies. Garfield lives 
        with his owner Jon and a dog named Odie. Garfield is known for being very lazy, hating
        mondays, and loving lasagna. He also loves his stuffed bear pookie.</p>

        <h4>Reasons I admire Garfield</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Garfield sleeps all day. I admire his commitment to doing nothing</li>
            <li class="highlighted">Garfield lives completely rent and bill free. I aspire to do the same</li>
            <li> Garfield eats seemingly limitless amounts of lasagna. As someone who is
             allergic to dairy, I admire his ability to eat dairy with no reaction</li>
        </ul>
